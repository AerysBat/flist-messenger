Version 0.8.4 released by Teal Deer, with permission of Viona, who will likely be back through later, with some moderately cleaner code. If you are interested in getting involved, please check out the current list of issues, for a good starting point!

- Open the CMakeLists.txt file with Qt Creator, after making sure that you have CMake and QtSDK correctly installed.
- After compiling, you need to move the following files to the output folder or you will get runtime errors: default.qss, default.css and colors.ini 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact Viona/Bastogne on F-chat, or post in the desktop client's group forums.

These files are the ones from the zip in the 0.8.4 release thread, in the release forum: http://www.f-list.net/forum.php?forum=1697
