A multi-platform desktop client for the F-Chat protocol. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Viona/Bastogne on F-chat, or post in the desktop client's group forums.

THE LATEST CODE IS THE 0.9.0 FOLDER. 
If you would like to work on this client, please work with 0.9.0. 0.9.0 requires Qt5. 
If you would like to compile and use this client, I suggest sticking to 0.8.4, for now. 0.8.4 requires Qt4.

More about this client, including detailed instructions for building under linux, can be found here: http://wiki.f-list.net/index.php/F-Chat_Desktop_Client

Most user bug reports will show up here: http://www.f-list.net/forum.php?forum=1698

Updated bugs for 0.9.0 will be added here, in the issues tracker, as soon as the Deer gets this thing to compile.
